        With the pandemic's persisting problems and alarming variants popping
        up, everyone's return to work looks different. Some have returned to
        their workplaces, while others have adapted to the new age of working
        from home, yet others are juggling both. As fashion lovers, we can all
        agree over the fact that it's time for a professional wardrobe refresh
        in 2022.Some people have become more than comfortable in their lounge
        sets and are now opting for comfy co-ord sets and loosely fit clothes.
        While some have welcomed back their love for dressing up with open arms.
        And if youâ€™re anything like me, then you know dressing up in the morning
        has and will always be a hassle for us. To save time picking what to
        wear to work, I've reduced my selections to a few basic office staples
        to create a simple professional capsule wardrobe.
